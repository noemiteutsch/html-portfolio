<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an up-and-coming web developer, interested in helping companies create a sustainable and successful brand through planning and ultimately web, logo, and app design via HTML.</p>

<p>Based in Kissimmee, FL, I work remotely. It is a dream come true to be able to travel the world, which is something I love, while simultaneously being able to work in a field that I also love. I am blessed with an abundance in joy as a result of choosing this career path.</p>

<p>I have poured thousands of hours into my craft. I am confident in my abilities and am always looking forward to the next new project. But not just any project, but a project I truly believe in. And that, I believe, is what sets me apart from other developers. When I choose a project, just know I am fully committed to creating the best outcome, and giving my all just like I have done for countless other clients. </p>
